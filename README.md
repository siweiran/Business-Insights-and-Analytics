Bias Analysis:
This report discusses the failure of Google Flu Trends (GFT) in 2013 and identifies various biases that led to incorrect predictions. To prevent these biases and issues, the report suggests increasing independent variables in data, supplementing the GFT algorithm with traditional research, and regularly updating relevant keywords.

Multimedia Allocation:
The report analyzes the effectiveness of advertising media and their synergies on sales, creating a model to allocate budgets effectively. The best-fit variables and synergies were identified, and elasticities were calculated to recommend budget changes. Additional variables were suggested to improve predictions.

Introducing Online Community:
The paper analyzes the impact of adding an online community feature to Nicht-Soporific on revenue, retention rates, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). Short-term revenue increased, but long-term retention rates declined for community members. CLV was higher for community members, with better retention and performance seen in organic customers compared to campaign acquired customers.

Recommendation System:
The report shows how to build a recommendation system using Collaborative Filtering to predict movie ratings. The best results were achieved with User-User Mean Centered Cosine Similarity. To address the cold start problem, different approaches were tested, with better predictions when more information was available. The report suggests exploring more sophisticated ML algorithms and granular user and movie information for better accuracy.
